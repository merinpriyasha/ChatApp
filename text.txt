Build and Deploy a Complete Chat App with MERN Stack | JWT, Socket.io, MongoDB | Beginner Friendly

how to add model, how to create relation ship between them 
how to design model for this chat app 
we use react and we create custome hooks for each operations  
this hook make our code more clean and make our code reasuable and maintainable 
in here we use state management solution - context in zustand

socket io - this is allow for our application to have the real time communication 

hooks , component and props

we create backend in root because it easy to deploy both backend and frontend in root

----------------------------------

MongoDB Atlas

userName = merinpriyasha
password = Sm7QERNSSPXH65jZ

if we donot want to have any other problems while developing use Zero ip address. it can be access in anywhere 
0.0.0.0 /0  --> this is only for development

ENUM =  enum: ["male", "female"] = the enum property is used to define a set of predefined values that a field (or attribute) can take. It acts as a constraint, ensuring that only specific, allowed values can be assigned to that field. This is useful for enforcing data integrity and preventing invalid data from being saved to the database.
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10) = if we put (50) then its more secure but it take more time to generate the salt. so this encryption can be slow.

to generate the Random JWT_SECRET = open git bash -> type 'openssl rand -base64 32'
JWT_TOKEN is the key to sign the token it is a digital signature. and when we verify the token we use the payload(userId)
